## Pagination

### Collection Size

By default the number of resources returned for all collection endpoints is set to a maximum of 500. Some endpoints may return a different size. `reviews` and `subjects` return a maximum collection size of 1,000. The value can be found on `pages.per_page`.

The `total_count` attribute is a count of all resources available within the [specified scope](#filters), not limited to pagination.

### Pagination

When there are more resources to return than the per-page limit, we use a [cursor-based pagination](https://www.sitepoint.com/paginating-real-time-data-cursor-based-pagination/) scheme to move through the subsequent results. We use the `id` of a resource as the cursor.

To make it super simple, collections have the following nested within a `pages` attribute:

Attribute | Description
--------- | -----------
`next_url` | A URL if the next page exists. Else the value is `null`.
`previous_url` | A URL if the previous page exists. Else the value is `null`.
`per_page` | Maximum number of resources delivered for this collection.

<aside class="notice">
Protip: the first page has no previous page, and the last page has no next page.
</aside>

The previous page of results can be requested by passing in the `page_before_id` parameter, with the value being the `id` you want to look before. Similar logic applies for the next page. Pass in the `page_after_id` parameter with with the `id` you want to look after.

If a cursor is outside the range of `id`s for the collection, an empty result set is returned for `data`.

#### Example

Letâ€™s say there are four resources with IDs of 1, 2, 3, 4.

* If we make a request with `...?page_after_id=2`, then we'll get resources with IDs&nbsp;3&nbsp;and&nbsp;4.
* If we make a request with `...?page_before_id=3`, then we'll get resources with IDs&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2.
* If we make a request with `...?page_after_id=5`, then we'll get a collection with an empty&nbsp;`data`&nbsp;field.
