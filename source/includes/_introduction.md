# Introduction

Welcome to the WaniKani API!

You can use our API to access read-only endpoints, which can get information on radicals, kanji, vocabulary, and the user's progress in our database.

All responses return JSON.

We currently have examples in Shell and Javascript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

  <strong>Expect breaking changes until the API v2 framework has been solidified. Keep in mind this is an alpha! There may be more endpoints to come and the structure of API results can be changed dramatically before the release.</strong>

<!-- ## Roadmap

The following are planned to be implemented before exiting beta:

* Soft deletion field.
* API terms and conditions.
* Inclusion of asset content:
  * Vocabulary audio
  * Sentences
  * Radical SVG and PNG
* JSON authentication endpoint for better extraction of API key.
* Move API v2 to subdomain api.wanikani.com/v2. -->
