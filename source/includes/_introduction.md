# Introduction

Welcome to the WaniKani API! You can use our API to access read-only endpoints, which can get information on radicals, kanji, vocabulary, and the user's progress in our database. All responses return JSON.

We currently have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
