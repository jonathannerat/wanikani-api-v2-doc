<strong>Expect breaking changes until the API v2 framework has been solidified. Keep in mind this is an alpha! There may be more endpoints to come and the structure of API results can be changed dramatically before the release.</strong>

Welcome to the WaniKani API! You can use our API to access read-only endpoints, which can get information on radicals, kanji, vocabulary, and the user's progress in our database.

All responses return JSON.

We currently have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
