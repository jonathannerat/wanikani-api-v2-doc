Attribute | Data Type | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`lessons` | Array of objects | Lessons contains one object with two keys: `available_at`, which should always be the beginning of the current hour, and `subject_ids`, which is an array of unique identifiers for [subjects](#subjects)
`reviews` | Array of objects | Reviews contains 25 objects with the same keys as lessons. The first object has an `available_at` at the beginning of the current hour. The subsequent objects have `available_at` values for each hour for the next 24 hours. Like lessons, the `subject_ids` array contains unique identifiers for the subjects that will appear in the review queue at that time.
